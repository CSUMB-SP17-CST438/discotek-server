# project3-jocruz-tha-pking-cyates
silent disco android app.


# Discoteque #
### Current State ###
The app streams musics. 




### Work Distribution ###
_Who worked on what_


* Joshua 'Ryan' Cruz: Backend Heroku Deployment, servers socket intergran, initial soundcloud integration, and database creation
* Tommy Ha: Socket integration, multiple classes, UI for displaying songs
* Peter King: UI skeleton, READMEs, rewrote user stories. 
* Kara Spencer: Media player
* Carsen Yates: android Interface, login functionality, android sockets. 




### What was completed ###
The application in its current form allows users to create accounts, login or enter as guests.


Currently all users join the same room. In the room, users can select from a list of songs, which is then stream to all
users connected to the room. 


The databases and backend framework are deployed on a heroku app that all the users interact with.




### Known Problems ###
Not for MVP goal. Songs will play indefinitely. Login and account creation does not work completely. 


### Future Improvements ###
For future improvements will continue create functionality based off of our users stories. Users be able to create, join, and 
leave different rooms. Users will only be able to choose songs only when it is their turn. Each room will have chat functionality and users 
will have profiles.
